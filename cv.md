## Projects

`February 2019`
[**UFOs:** Lazy larger-than-memory object arrays via userfaultfd](https://github.com/ufo-org/)  
User provides an arbitrary function to populate a chunk of memory. 
Framework allocates an area of memory and transparently executes the population function when a chunk is read or written to
Chunks are seemlessly garbage-collected and re-generated as needed. 
Example implementations generate in-memory arrays from columns in CSV files, BZIP file, and formulas
Comes with C, R, and Rust bindings  
My contribution: Back-ends, R bindings and utilities, parts of garbage collection. 

`July 2020`
[**CodeDJ:** Reproducible queries over large-scale software repositories](https://codedj-prg.github.io)  
Infrastructure for querying GitHub and similar repositories for quantitative software engineering research (especially project selection) in large code datasets. 
It prioritizes reproducibility and scalability and consists of two modules. 
*Parasite* is an incremental downloader and persistent datastore. 
*Djanco* is an in-memory database and query language embedded in Rust  
My contribution: Djanco and surrounding tooling

`February 2021`
[**FML:** A small runtime for teaching runtimes](https://github.com/kondziu/FML)  
Toy bytecode compiler and interpreter designed as a model for student implementations in a runtimes class
Runs a vaguelky ML-like toy dynamic language with objects, inheritence, dynamic dispatch and garbage collection but not much else. 
The compiler generates slightly extended Feeny bytecode (another teaching language) consisting of 17 ops and 7 internal objects  
My contribution: Everything

`July 2021`

[**AtomicRMI:** Pessimistic distributed transactional memory system over Java RMI](https://github.com/kondziu/AtomicRMI)  
Implementation of pessimistic transactional concurrency control for Java RMI
RMI objects are instrumented to 
The algorithm assigns versions to shared objects and uses them to guide how transactions lock and release them
It uses upper bounds on the number of accesses of an object within transactions to release locks early, if this is safe. 
It also uses local buffers to defer the need to synchronize transactions in specific situations  
My contribution: Optimizations to the original algorithms, most of the implementation
